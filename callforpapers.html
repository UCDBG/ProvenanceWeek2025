      Call for Papers
    </h2>
    <p>
      <span>
        We invite innovative and creative contributions, including papers that outline new formal approaches to provenance, explore innovative uses of provenance, provide experience-based insights, and present visionary ideas. ProvenanceWeek continues the tradition of fostering a genuine workshop environment where participants can discuss and develop new ideas, as well as explore connections between different disciplines and academic research on provenance alongside practical applications. We strive to support diverse conversations from all fields, bringing together researchers from a wide range of computer science domains, such as workflows, databases, high-performance computing, distributed systems, operating systems, programming languages, and software engineering, all of which have significant provenance needs. 
        <!-- Submission topics reflect the cross-cutting nature of this field, including, but not limited to: -->
